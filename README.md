# comfy_store
A store created with the mother of all techs JS, faraway of all modern techs, I created that store
to practice more on JS specially in OOP Paradaigm.

I used redux to manage the store state in a predictable way, and to convinet myself that it is independent about react :DD

#### Built with
- JS (OOP, JSON, ASYNC await, REGEX);
- Redux;
- Tailwindcss;
- Jest;
